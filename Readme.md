# Parser Monad for Lisp lists in Emacs Lisp

- Implements the basic combinators from https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf

- Based on the Elisp monad code of https://github.com/cute-jumper/monad.el
  - Mainly taking advantage of the existing do-notation code.
  - And also using the Maybe monad from it.

---

- Could add more combinators.
- Could put more thought into making the type signatures more precise.
- Could provide nice examples.
